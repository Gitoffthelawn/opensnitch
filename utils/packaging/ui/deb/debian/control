Description: GNU/Linux interactive application firewall
 opensnitch-ui is a GUI for opensnitch written in Python.
 It allows the user to view live outgoing connections, as well as search
 for details of the intercepted connections.
 .
 The user can decide if block outgoing connections based on properties of
 the connection: by port, by uid, by dst ip, by program or a combination
 of them.
 .
 These rules can last forever, until restart the daemon or just one time.
 .
 OpenSnitch can also work as a system-wide domains blocker, by using lists
 of domains, list of IPs or list of regular expressions.
